# MiniFramework

MiniFramework is a lightweight custom JavaScript UI framework that provides basic functionality similar to React. It includes support for functional components, state management, and lifecycle hooks like `useEffect`. This framework is built for learning purposes and to demonstrate how modern frontend frameworks like React work under the hood.

## Features

- **Custom JSX-like syntax**: Create elements using a custom `createElement` function.
- **State management**: Manage component state with `useState`.
- **Lifecycle methods**: Use `useEffect` to handle side effects in functional components.
- **Class-based components**: Support for class-based components with lifecycle hooks.
- **Component re-rendering**: Automatic re-rendering when state changes.

## Installation
